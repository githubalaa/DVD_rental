# DVD_rental
In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I'd querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as How many family-friendly movies are renting, What is the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies, What are the top 10 rental movies and Identify 10 customers who made the highest total amount of payment.


**To better understandind the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided as ERB.**
